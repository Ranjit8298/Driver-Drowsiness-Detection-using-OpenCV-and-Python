# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-using-OpenCV-and-Python
Nowadays the driver safety in the car is one of the most wanted system to avoid accidents. Our objective of the project is to ensure the safety system so we are creating a system that can detect real time driver drowsiness and alert the driver.
#How to run the code:
step-1: Your system should have python 3.7 to 3.10 version.
step-2:Your system should have python code editor like: pycharm
step-3:Your system should have 68 landmark shape predictor file. You can easily download given below link:

step-4:Your system should have below given python libraries:
          1.OpenCV
          2.dlib
          3.numpy
          4.scipy
          5.imutils
          6.pyglet
          7.playsound
          8.argparse
 
 OpenCV- pip install opencv-python
 numpy- pip install numpy
 scipy- pip install scipy
 imutils- pip install imutils
 pyglet- pip install pyglet
 playsound- pip install playsound
 argparse- pip install argparse
 You can easily install above libraries but may be you can stuck to install dlib library. Don't worry I am here for you. Go through the below given link you can easily install dlib library.
